SQL statements are grouped into three main logical groups:

Data Definition Language (DDL)
Data Control Language (DCL)
Data Manipulation Language (DML)

You use DDL statements to create, modify, and remove tables and other objects in a database (table, stored procedures, views, and so on).

The most common DDL statements are:

Statement	Description
CREATE	Create a new object in the database, such as a table or a view.
ALTER	Modify the structure of an object. For instance, altering a table to add a new column.
DROP	Remove an object from the database.
RENAME	Rename an existing object.


DCL statements
Database administrators generally use DCL statements to manage access to objects in a database by granting, denying, or revoking permissions to specific users or groups.

The three main DCL statements are:

Statement	Description
GRANT	Grant permission to perform specific actions
DENY	Deny permission to perform specific actions
REVOKE	Remove a previously granted permission

For example
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE
ON Product
TO user1;



DML statements
You use DML statements to manipulate the rows in tables. These statements enable you to retrieve (query) data, insert new rows, or modify existing rows. You can also delete rows if you don't need them anymore.

The four main DML statements are:

Statement	Description
SELECT	Read rows from a table
INSERT	Insert new rows into a table
UPDATE	Modify data in existing rows
DELETE	Delete existing rows
