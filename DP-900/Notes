Types of data
 structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.

Structured data is data that adheres to a fixed schema, so all of the data has the same fields or properties.stly in a tabulated format. 
Semi-structured data is information that has some structure, but which allows for some variation between entity instances. One common format for semi-structured data is JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). 

Example of a JSON Format below
// Customer 1
{
  "firstName": "Joe",
  "lastName": "Jones",
  "address":
  {
    "streetAddress": "1 Main St.",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postalCode": "10099"
  },
  "contact":
  [
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "555 123-1234"
    },
    {
      "type": "email",
      "address": "joe@litware.com"
    }
  ]
}

// Customer 2
{
  "firstName": "Samir",
  "lastName": "Nadoy",
  "address":
  {
    "streetAddress": "123 Elm Pl.",
    "unit": "500",
    "city": "Seattle",
    "state": "WA",
    "postalCode": "98999"
  },
  "contact":
  [
    {
      "type": "email",
      "address": "samir@northwind.com"
    }
  ]
}

Unstructured data
Not all data is structured or even semi-structured. For example, documents, images, audio and video data, and binary files might not have a specific structure. This kind of data is referred to as unstructured data.


Categories of data store
filestores and databases. 

Relational databases
Relational databases are commonly used to store and query structured data. 
The data is stored in tables that represent entities, such as customers, products, or sales orders.
 Each instance of an entity is assigned a primary key that uniquely identifies it; and these keys are used to reference the entity instance in other tables.


Non-relational databases
Non-relational databases are data management systems that donâ€™t apply a relational schema to the data. 
Non-relational databases are often referred to as NoSQL database, even though some support a variant of the SQL language.
